**Forest fires detection**

Authors: Jakub Mendyk, Mariusz Zalewski, Bartosz Zimo≈Ñczyk

Our project is about bushfires detecting from the linescans - aerial photos in infrared. We are given two datasets:
1. Linescans - dataset provided by Open Data Cube, consisting of aerial photos from Australia, Victoria
2. Fire boundaries - hand-drawn polygons provided by Country Fire Authority from Australia

Our aim is to build a model (neural net), able to detect a bushfire from an aerial photo.

Our inspiration came from a contest organised by EY, in which we participated. **It concluded on the 16th of June, we finished at the 32nd place in global ranking (out of 200+ teams) and we were the 3rd best team from Poland!**
